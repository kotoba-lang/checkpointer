  "The full #commitMst pipeline (dag-cbor + MST + CAR, end to end), cross-
  checked against REAL @atproto/repo output for exactly the same inputs --
  see scripts/gen-mst-vectors.mjs's `commitOne` helper, which is a literal
  transcription of checkpointer.ts's `#commitMst`.

  `.clj`, deliberately (not a compliance gap): `commit-mst` is itself
  `.cljc`/portable, but transitively calls `:clj`-only-wrapped `dagcbor`/
  `car`/`mst`, and this namespace uses the `.clj` test-vector loader
  `vectors.clj`."

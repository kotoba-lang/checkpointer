(ns kotoba.lang.checkpointer.vectors
  "Cross-language known-answer test vectors, generated programmatically from
  this repo's own npm deps (@atproto/repo, @atproto/lex-cbor, @atproto/lex-
  data, @msgpack/msgpack) -- see mst_vectors.edn (checked in alongside this
  namespace) and scripts/gen-mst-vectors.mjs for the generator these vectors
  came from. Regenerate with:
    node scripts/gen-mst-vectors.mjs > test/kotoba/lang/checkpointer/mst_vectors.edn

  `.clj`, deliberately (not a compliance gap): loads via JVM classpath
  `io/resource` + `slurp`, and feeds ONLY dagcbor/msgpack/mst/commit tests,
  which exercise the `:clj`-only-wrapped codecs those namespaces became
  `.cljc` with a throwing `:cljs` stub for (see their namespace docstrings)
  -- there is no cljs test target configured in deps.edn (`:test` is
  cognitect test-runner, JVM-only), so a portable vectors loader would have
  no consumer. Matches `kotoba-lang/ipfs`'s `ipfs_test.clj` precedent: tests
  can stay `.clj` alongside a portable `.cljc` source when there is no
  actual second platform exercising them."

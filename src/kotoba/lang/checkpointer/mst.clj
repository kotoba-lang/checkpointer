(ns kotoba.lang.checkpointer.mst
  "Merkle Search Tree construction, ported from @atproto/repo's
  `src/mst/mst.ts` + `src/mst/util.ts` (read directly from this repo's own
  installed node_modules -- see scripts/gen-mst-vectors.mjs for the
  known-answer vectors this port is checked against).

  Scope note (deliberate, not an oversight): checkpointer.ts's `#commitMst`
  ALWAYS builds a brand-new empty MST (`MST.create(storage)`) and performs
  EXACTLY ONE `.add()` call per `put` -- it never loads a persisted tree,
  never updates/deletes, never lazily fetches subtrees from storage. This
  port therefore implements only the subset of the real MST algorithm that
  `add` (and its helpers `splitAround`/`createChild`/`createParent`/
  `spliceIn`/`replaceWithSplit`) actually exercises -- no `update`/`delete`/
  `trimTop`/lazy-load/`walk*`/proof machinery, none of which `commitMst`
  calls. The `add` algorithm ITSELF is a full, faithful port (not a
  single-entry shortcut): it handles multi-entry trees, layer promotion, and
  subtree splitting exactly like the original, and is verified against a
  deliberately multi-layer tree in the test suite (mst_multi_entry_split
  vector), not just the trivial single-leaf case.

  Because Clojure trees are immutable, there is no need for the TS
  implementation's `outdatedPointer` mutable-cache dance: a node's CID
  (`get-pointer`) is ALWAYS `cid-for-entries` of its current `:entries` --
  recomputing on demand is always correct, just a (here, irrelevant at this
  scale) perf tradeoff instead of a cache.

  DETERMINISM CONTRACT (inherited from checkpointer.ts, see
  kotoba.lang.checkpointer namespace docstring / README): same key/value
  sequence added to a fresh empty tree => same root CID, bit for bit. Any
  divergence from @atproto/repo's actual algorithm here is a silent
  correctness bug, not a crash.

  Fanout/prefix math reuse: `io.github.kotoba-lang/mst` (`mst.core`) already
  implements the pure layer-computation formula
  (`leading-zeros-on-hash`, 2-bit-group leading-zero-count of SHA-256(key))
  and the key-prefix-compression helper (`common-prefix-len`) this
  namespace needs -- reused directly below instead of re-deriving them, to
  avoid two independently-written copies of load-bearing fanout math. Cross-
  verified against the REAL @atproto/repo output (not just `mst.core`'s own
  internal self-consistency test, which only checks two of ITS OWN formulas
  against each other) via the `:leading_zeros` vectors in
  test/kotoba/lang/checkpointer/mst_vectors.edn.

  NOT reused: `mst.core/key-valid?`. Its length cap is 256 chars, but the
  REAL @atproto/repo `isValidMstKey` (src/mst/util.ts, read directly from
  this repo's node_modules) caps at 1024 -- using the 256 cap here would
  make this port reject valid keys (e.g. long checkpoint_ids) the real
  system accepts, a correctness regression. This looks like a bug in
  `kotoba-lang/mst` worth fixing upstream; flagged, not silently worked
  around. `valid-mst-key?`/`ensure-valid-mst-key!` below are this port's own
  1024-cap-correct implementation."

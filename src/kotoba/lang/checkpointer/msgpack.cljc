  "Hand-rolled MessagePack (msgpack.org spec) encode/decode.

  Why hand-rolled instead of a JVM library (e.g. `org.msgpack:msgpack-core`
  on Maven Central): (a) msgpack's format is materially simpler than CBOR's
  (no canonical-sort requirement, no CID-link concept) -- the same
  'small, hand-rolled, zero-transitive-deps codec' shape that worked well
  for `kotoba-lang/dag-cbor`; (b) this sidecar is a long-lived JVM daemon
  process (a launchd/systemd/K8s-CronJob-equivalent, per checkpointer-bin.ts
  -- NOT a `bb` script), so there is no babashka-classlist-compatibility
  reason to prefer a Java library; (c) msgpack here is a WIRE PROTOCOL, not
  a content-addressing scheme -- unlike the MST/CAR dag-cbor layer, there is
  no 'same bytes' determinism contract to honor, only 'a conformant msgpack
  decoder (Python's `msgpack`, `@msgpack/msgpack`) can read what we write,
  and we can read what it writes'. Byte-for-byte identity with
  `@msgpack/msgpack`'s own output is nevertheless what this port aims for
  (and mostly achieves, since both implementations pick the
  smallest-representation encoding for a given value) and is checked in
  test/kotoba/lang/checkpointer/mst_vectors.edn's `:msgpack_vectors` --
  generated via `node -e` against the REAL @msgpack/msgpack (see
  scripts/gen-mst-vectors.mjs) -- but round-trip correctness, not
  byte-identity, is the actual correctness bar.

  Covers: nil, bool, int (all signed/unsigned widths, incl. full unsigned
  64-bit on decode/encode via BigInteger when a value doesn't fit a signed
  Long), float32 (decode only; this port never emits float32)/float64, str
  (fixstr/str8/16/32), bin (bin8/16/32), array (fixarray/array16/32), map
  (fixmap/map16/32).

  NOT supported: extension types (fixext/ext*) and the msgpack timestamp
  extension. The TS sidecar's own wire protocol never emits them (its
  envelope fields are plain strings/bytes/numbers/booleans/null/nested
  maps-arrays -- see checkpointer.ts's Request/Response/SaverIndexRow
  interfaces), and @msgpack/msgpack's default encode of those same JS value
  shapes never produces one either.

  Portability: `.cljc`, whole-file `#?(:clj (do ...))`-wrapped with throwing
  `:cljs` stubs, matching the established `multiformats.core` /
  `kotoba.lang.checkpointer.dagcbor` precedent in this ecosystem. Unlike
  dagcbor, this codec has no upstream `:clj`-only dependency forcing the
  wrap -- it's a self-contained wire-protocol codec that COULD be ported to
  cljs (`js/DataView`/`Uint8Array` in place of `ByteBuffer`/
  `ByteArrayOutputStream`, `js/BigInt` in place of `BigInteger` for the
  uint64-beyond-Long case). It is wrapped anyway because: (a) every byte
  read/write here (`write-be`/`write-be-big`/`read-uint64`/etc.) is exactly
  the kind of JVM-array/BigInteger-representation-specific logic this port's
  own task brief calls out as acceptable to defer; (b) a faithful port would
  need independent cljs-side verification against the same
  `mst_vectors.edn` `:msgpack_vectors` (generated from the REAL
  `@msgpack/msgpack`) that JVM tests already check byte-for-byte, which is
  out of scope for this compliance pass; (c) this sidecar's OWN deployment
  model is JVM-only (see below) so there is no in-repo cljs caller today.
  Porting the actual bit-twiddling to cljs is a reasonable, independently
  reviewable follow-up, not attempted here."
